## About CaseMaker

CaseMaker is a case study library and creation tool sponsored by <a href="https://www.urc-chs.com/">University Research Co, LLC</a> and the Implementation Science Collaborative. This web-based platform allows international health researchers to easily create case studies describing their projects. By creating a standard library for global health case studies, researchers can more quickly publish the results of their studies, outlining methodology and key learnings. This library gathers together the latest efforts in international health program implementation to facilitate shared learning and encourage opportunities for collaboration among partners.
